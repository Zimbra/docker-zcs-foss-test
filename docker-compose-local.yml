# NOTE: if you want to be able to expose these ports to the ingress network so that
#       you can, for example, log into Zimbra via a web browser from the host machine,
#       you have comment out the following and also change the endpoint_mode
#       for the zimbra_container (above) to vip instead of dnsrr.
#
#       This is not done by default because the test container needs to be able
#       to access the actual IP address of the single zimbra container.
#       In vip mode, you get the IP address of the mesh routing service and NOT
#       the IP address of the actual Zimbra node.
